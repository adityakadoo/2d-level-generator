# 2d-level-generator
A procedural 2D level generation library utilizing the Wave-Function
Collapse (WFC) algorithm in Haskell programming language.
The library comes with all the necessary utilities to process various tile-sets and their
constraints. This library can also visualize the process of generation of the 2-dimensional game
layouts through a graphical interface. The generation strategies can be switched and compared
easily.
